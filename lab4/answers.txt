# EXERCISE 1: What method you used to make your peer download and upload files
# in parallel?  (~1-3 sentences)
We simply forked the processes as we did in earlier labs to run the downloads in
parallel. We do the same for uploads as ell, although it took a little more work
understanding the task_upload when the forked processe's pid was 0. Basically,
we had to free the current task in the parent process while executing the upload
in the child process - a minor bump but we managed to pull through.

# EXERCISE 2A: What conditions did you find and fix that would have triggered a
# buffer overrun bug?  (~1-3 sentences each)

The size for the filename was being written to a buffer in an unprotected
manner. Thus, instead of using strcpy, we use strncpy and specify a strict file
size. In addition, we noticed that the size of TASK_BUFF_SIZE did not appear to
be large enough to accommodate the large number of tasks that would be requested
of our peer in make popular (we considered this a sort of overflow of requests).
To fix this, we increased the buffer size by an order of magnitude, thereby
enabling our code to take care of the requests. 

# EXERCISE 2B: What other robustness problems did you fix?  (~1-3 sentences
# each)

We implemented a simple check against peers trying to access other directories.
We simply compare the string of the absolute directory we are in with the
absolute directory the peer is trying to to access. If the peer's absolute path
differs from our absolute path, then it must be trying to access something
outside the test directory, which is evil. 

Also, we ensure resource monopolization does not occur. If a particular IP address
tries to download files more than 10 times, we consider this highly unlikely to be
a sensible guy. Thus, we cut him off. We realize that this is slightly naive, considering
that we do not check the time between file requests, there is a chance that a normal peer
is trying to access > 10 files over a span of, say, a day. This is also a subtle defense.
In the same way a software should report that either a username or a password is wrong
so that an attacker looking to do a brute force attack won't know which one is wrong, 
our defense does not tell the attacker that we failed to serve his request. Instead, it
merely continues operations like normal, and present the attacker with an empty file.

# EXERCISE 3: Describe the attacks you implemented for "evil mode".  Why are
# they attacks?  (~3-10 sentences each)

1. If someone connects to our peer in order to download a file, we commence a
buffer overflow attack on the aforementioned security hole in the file name. On
a peer where this issue has not been patched, the overflow should create a
segmentation fault.

2. We also attempt to exploit a normal peer's lack of defense against change
in directory by trying to access '/etc/passwd'. We realize this is naive; no simple
attack like this will give me permission to this file (considering write permissions and suid
stuff is unique for this file). However the implications of this kind of attack is very real,
and gaining access to a single line in this file can be devastating. 

# Extra credit problems
# Extra credit problem: yes

We did the MD5 checksum (to the best of our ability). Every time we try and our peer tries to access
a download, we build the checksum based on the content of the data, and check it against the registered
cheksum of the file. If they don't match, the integrity has been construed. Else, it is an untouched 
file (at least, untouched between it's registration and our access of it).
